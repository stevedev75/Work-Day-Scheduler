# JavaScript Coding Quiz

## Application to generate a workday schedule (9am to 5pm) using some sample code provided by Trilogy.

My motivation for this project was to create a web application that used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Moment.js, and Bootstrap (along with some basic starter HTML and CSS code),
to create a practical scheduler that accepts text and saves the time and text in local storage, providing a good user experience. 

I built this project, in part, to showcase my understanding of JavaScript, JQuery, and third-party APIs.

This application solves the problem often of how to build an application that uses multiple kinds of files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) which interact with one another through the DOM to provide a seamless user experience -- taking advantage of the "libraries" of jQuery, Bootstrap, and the functionality of Moment.js.

In this project, I learned a lot -- more specifically -- about jQuery and traversing the DOM.
